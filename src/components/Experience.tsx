              Interning at Dream Suites was my debut in the world of
              professional web development, and it was an experience Iâ€™ll truly
              never forget. During my time, I gained real-world experience
              designing and re-developing the Dream Suites homepage using HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript using the WordPress framework.

              As a car enthusiast, landing a co-op at Nissan was a dream come
              true. Under the vehicle planning team, I spent my time optimizing
              tasks that were done manually on Excel. I would work one-on-one
              with various team members, shadowing them and making sure I knew
              exactly what kind of steps they would take to finish a task. I
              would then develop a macro in VBA that would automate these steps,
              saving minutes or even hours of time.

              Rogers will always hold a special place in my heart for being my
              first ever co-op. As part of the network engineering team, I was
              supposed to work alongside the civil engineers to work design and
              work with civil engineering documents. However, since the pandemic
              struck and I was no longer able to work at the office, the planned
              structure around this co-op changed.

              Since there was no planned work for me, I took the initiative to
              undertake a project where I moved cell tower data from various
              Excel files into a consolidated Access database. After pitching
              this idea to my manager, he loved it and I took charge of the
              project. By the end of the term, I was able to build the framework
              for an Access database, fully completed the data transfer with
              data normalization to 1NF standard, and developed several SQL
              queries to make common use cases easier.{" "}
